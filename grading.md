This quiz was well done and met the following requirements:
- listed the quiz's objective
- included a citation for information used to create/answer git questions
-- (in future work, I will be seeking full / proper APA formatted citations, but this gives me the basic information needed to follow your references)
- 15 questions, no more than 5 T/F, and more info in answer key about correct answers
Notes on the questions:
- on #5 in multiple choice questions, in the answer key explantaion for D, I would add to the end of the statement - to clarify - "... and commits the files in the staging area to the repository, thus removing the files from staging"
